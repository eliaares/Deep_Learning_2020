# Deep_Learning_2020

## Project Introduction

Deep Learning 2020: Large Scale Object Detection
Created by: Èlia Armengol, Gabriela Cid and Jordi Marín.

Our objective during this project was to see if we could improve the code provided to us. The code was a Single Shot Detection convolutional neural network. That worked using three types of convolutions: Base convolutions, auxiliary convolutions and prediction convolutions. The accuracy of the model was around 70%.

## Code

We can find the code in the files above witht he data needed to compile. The changes we explored are put as comments in the code.


## Conclusions

None of the changes explored were a good way to better the code; some made accuracy worse and some made the compiling time much worse. Everything is explained in the code.
